There are two mathematically defined metrics, CEI and ERS, to promote adequate and refined exploitation, respectively. Moreover, a self-tuning dynamic parameter is further defined to balance these metrics. All of them are included in the standard PPO objective, guiding agents to update policies with clear individual contributions.
